# pyside2-wheels

This project aims to build PySide2 wheels on multiple platforms using Travis-CI and Appveyor.

:fire: Please cast a vote [here](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-558) to have QtC prioritize the development of official PySide2 wheels.

:warning: The wheels being produced here are not "portable" or "standalone" and do require Qt5 libraries installed locally.


## Quickstart

Pre-built wheels are available on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/pyside2/_latestVersion#files) and can be installed as long as prerequisites are in place (see [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)).

* [pyside2-wheels/pyside2](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/pyside2#files) - wheels built from the master branch
* [pyside2-wheels/development](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/development#files) - wheels built from any non-master branch


## Wheel building details

If you wish to build the wheel yourself or see more details on what's included in the wheels:

- [CENTOS.md](CENTOS.md)
- [UBUNTU.md](UBUNTU.md)
- [MACOS.md](MACOS.md)
- [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md)

# pyside2-wheels

The wheels being produced are not "portable" or "standalone" and do require Qt5 libraries installed locally. This project could potentially implement such features by looking at [how PyQt5 does this](https://github.com/pyqt/python-qt5/wiki/Updating-the-repository#bundling).

For more information, see [this guide](https://fredrikaverpil.github.io/2016/08/17/compiling-pyside2/) on compiling PySide2.

## Wheel building

Wheels are created by Travis CI (Linux, OS X) and AppVeyor (Windows). They are then uploaded to Bintray:

* [pyside2-wheels/pyside2](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/pyside2#files) - wheels built from the master branch
* [pyside2-wheels/development](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/development#files) - wheels built from pull requests and non-master branch commits

### Ubuntu 16.04

Note: Not all modules are found during PySide2 wheel building: [PYSIDE-343](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-343)

```bash
# Build containers
docker build -f Dockerfile-ubuntu16.04-py2.7 -t fredrikaverpil/pyside2-ubuntu16.04-py2.7 .
docker build -f Dockerfile-ubuntu16.04-py3.5 -t fredrikaverpil/pyside2-ubuntu16.04-py3.5 .

# Build wheels
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/pyside-setup/dist fredrikaverpil/pyside2-ubuntu16.04-py2.7
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/pyside-setup/dist fredrikaverpil/pyside2-ubuntu16.04-py3.5
```

### CentOS 6, 7

Note: A hack was implemented to work around this issue: [PYSIDE-342](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-342)

```bash
# Build containers
docker build -f Dockerfile-centos6-py2.7 -t fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos6-py2.7 .
docker build -f Dockerfile-centos6-py3.5 -t fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos6-py3.5 .
docker build -f Dockerfile-centos7-py2.7 -t fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos7-py2.7 .
docker build -f Dockerfile-centos7-py3.5 -t fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos7-py3.5 .

# Build wheels
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/pyside-setup/dist fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos6-py2.7
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/pyside-setup/dist fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos6-py3.5
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/pyside-setup/dist fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos7-py2.7
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/pyside-setup/dist fredrikaverpil/pyside2-centos7-py3.5
```

### Mac OS X

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x build_osx_py2.7.sh
chmod +x build_osx_py3.5.sh

# Install prerequisites and build wheels
./build_osx_py2.7.sh
./build_osx_py3.5.sh
```

### Windows

Note: No wheels are generated for Python 2.7 since it is built using MSVC9 (Visual Studio 2008) and Qt5 *isn't* built with MSVC9. Mixing MSVC versions is risky as resulting errors can be very hard to solve.

Download and install:

* [Microsoft C++ Visual Studio 2015, v14.0](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download) >= v3.0
* [OpenSSL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openssl)
* Qt5 compiled with MSVC2015 from the [Qt archives](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/)
* [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org) - which is built using MSVC2015

Please see [`appveyor.yml`](https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/blob/master/appveyor.yml) for build commands.

## Installing and using the wheels

### OS X

You need Python and Qt5 installed just like in the build environments. Please see `build_osx_pyX.X.sh` for details on OS X. This example is for Python 3.5:

1. Download a wheel from [Bintray](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/pyside2/_latestVersion#files).
2. "pip install" the downloaded wheel: `pip install PySide2*.whl`
3. Avoid @rpath errors: `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/PySide2/` (see [this PySide(1) issue](https://github.com/PySide/PySide/issues/129) for more information)
4. Test it: `python3 -c "from PySide2 import QtWidgets, QtCore"`

## Contributing to this project

Fork this project and create a pull request. Wheels will be built and uploaded to the Bintray [development package](https://bintray.com/fredrikaverpil/pyside2-wheels/development/_latestVersion#files) for each commit you do. The wheels will be organized in Bintray by your pull request title.
